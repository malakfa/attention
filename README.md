# Attention Analysis with BERT

## Overview

The Attention Analysis project involves utilizing BERT, a transformer-based language model, to predict masked words and visualize attention scores. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is trained using a Masked Language Model approach, where it learns to predict masked words based on surrounding context words. The project aims to analyze the attention mechanism of BERT by generating attention diagrams for each of its 144 attention heads and interpreting the patterns observed.

## BERT and Attention Mechanism

BERT employs a transformer architecture, which utilizes an attention mechanism to understand language. In the base BERT model, there are 12 layers, each with 12 self-attention heads, totaling 144 self-attention heads. These attention heads allow BERT to focus on different parts of the input sequence and capture meaningful relationships between words.

## Project Workflow

1. **BERT Model Implementation:** Use the transformers Python library by Hugging Face to develop a program that employs BERT for predicting masked words.
2. **Attention Visualization:** Generate attention diagrams for each of the 144 attention heads to visualize where BERT's attention is focused.
3. **Attention Analysis:** Analyze the attention diagrams to gain insights into what BERT's attention heads are paying attention to as it processes natural language text.
4. **Interpretation:** Interpret the patterns observed in the attention diagrams to understand how BERT captures semantic relationships and dependencies between words.

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with different input sequences to observe variations in attention patterns.
- Explore advanced visualization techniques to enhance the interpretation of attention diagrams.
- Integrate the attention analysis with downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering.
